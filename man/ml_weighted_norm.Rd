\title{Machine-learning weighted p-norm composite indicator}
\usage{
ml_weighted_norm(Z, weights, p = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{A numeric matrix or data frame of indicator values. Each row
corresponds to a statistical unit and each column corresponds to an
individual indicator.}

\item{weights}{A numeric vector of non-negative weights. Its length must
match the number of columns of \code{Z}. The weights are usually obtained
from one of the DL2 weight-estimation functions such as
\code{\link{weights_from_rf}}, \code{\link{weights_from_mars}}, or
\code{\link{weights_from_nn}}.}

\item{p}{A positive real number indicating the order of the norm. The default
is \code{2}, corresponding to a weighted Euclidean distance. Values of
\code{p < 1} are not allowed.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length equal to the number of rows of \code{Z},
containing the DL2 weighted \eqn{p}-norm composite indicator for each unit.
}
\description{
Computes a weighted \eqn{p}-norm for each statistical unit, where the
weights are typically obtained from machine-learning procedures such as
random forests, MARS, or neural networks. This function forms the core of the
DL2 composite indicator, translating a matrix of indicator values and a
weight vector into a synthetic distance-based index.
}
\details{
The function computes, for each statistical unit \eqn{i}, the expression
\deqn{
  CI_i = \left( \sum_{j=1}^m w_j |Z_{ij}|^p \right)^{1/p},
}
where \eqn{w_j} are the weights and \eqn{Z_{ij}} are the indicator values.
The function performs basic dimensionality checks and converts inputs to the
appropriate numeric form.

This function is used iteratively within
\code{\link{ci_ml_fixedpoint}} to compute the DL2 composite indicator during
the fixed-point procedure. It is also used in robustness analyses such as
\code{\link{robust_ci_vs_weights}}.
