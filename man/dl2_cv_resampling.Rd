\arguments{
\item{Z}{A numeric matrix or data frame of indicators, where rows represent
statistical units and columns correspond to individual indicators.}

\item{weight_method}{Character string indicating the machine-learning method
used to estimate weights. Must be one of \code{"rf"}, \code{"mars"}, or
\code{"nn"}. Defaults to \code{"rf"}.}

\item{B}{Integer specifying the number of bootstrap or resampling replications.
Defaults to \code{100}.}

\item{prop}{Proportion of units included in each resampling replication.
Defaults to \code{0.8}. The procedure uses bootstrap sampling by default
(sampling with replacement).}

\item{p}{Order of the norm used to compute the DL2 index. Defaults to \code{2}.}

\item{ntree}{Number of trees used when \code{weight_method = "rf"}.
Defaults to \code{500}.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations allowed in the DL2 fixed-point
algorithm. Defaults to \code{50}.}

\item{lambda}{Damping parameter used for weight updating in the iterative
DL2 procedure. Must lie between zero and one. Defaults to \code{0.2}.}

\item{n_stable}{Number of consecutive iterations falling below the tolerance
threshold required to declare convergence. Defaults to \code{3}.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer seed for reproducibility. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether progress information should be
displayed. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{

the baseline index and resampled indices.
\item \code{rho_kendall}: Vector of Kendall rank correlations.
\item \code{L1_w}: L1 distances between baseline and re-estimated weights.
\item \code{summary_spearman}: Summary statistics of the Spearman correlations.
\item \code{summary_kendall}: Summary statistics of the Kendall correlations.
\item \code{summary_L1_w}: Summary statistics of the L1 weight differences.
\item \code{res_base}: The full-sample DL2 estimation used as the benchmark.

\description{
Performs a resampling-based validation procedure for the DL2 composite
indicator using bootstrap or subsampling. This function evaluates the
robustness of the final DL2 index and its associated weights under repeated
perturbations of the dataset. The method re-estimates the DL2 composite
indicator on multiple bootstrap samples and compares each re-estimated index
with the baseline index obtained from the full dataset.
}
\details{
This function implements a modular resampling strategy designed to evaluate the
stability and robustness of the DL2 composite indicator under repeated random
perturbations of the dataset. For each replication, a bootstrap sample is drawn,
the DL2 index is re-estimated using the chosen machine-learning method, and the
resulting index is compared with the baseline index computed from the full sample.

The method quantifies robustness through:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Spearman correlation}: Measures monotonic ranking similarity.
\item \strong{Kendall correlation}: Measures pairwise ordinal concordance.
\item \strong{L1 difference in weights}: Measures sensitivity of the weight
vector to resampling fluctuations.
}

This procedure is particularly useful when selecting among alternative
machine-learning weighting methods by providing empirical evidence of which
method yields the most stable and reliable DL2 composite indicator.
