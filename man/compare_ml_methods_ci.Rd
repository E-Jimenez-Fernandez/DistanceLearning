\title{Comparison of DL2 composite indicators across machine-learning weighting methods}
\usage{
compare_ml_methods_ci(
  Z,
  p = 2,
  ntree = 500,
  max_iter = 50,
  lambda = 0.2,
  n_stable = 3,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{A numeric matrix or data frame of indicators where rows represent
units and columns correspond to individual indicators.}

\item{p}{Numeric value specifying the order of the norm used in the DL2
composite indicator. Defaults to \code{2}.}

\item{ntree}{Integer indicating the number of trees used when
\code{weight_method = "rf"} (Random Forests). Defaults to \code{500}.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations in the DL2 fixed-point algorithm.
Defaults to \code{50}.}

\item{lambda}{Damping parameter used to update the weights iteratively.
Must lie in \eqn{(0,1)}. Defaults to \code{0.2}.}

\item{n_stable}{Integer specifying how many consecutive iterations must fall
below the internal tolerance threshold to declare convergence. Defaults to
\code{3}.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer seed for reproducibility. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{RF_vs_MARS}: List of Spearman, Kendall, and Pearson correlations
between the DL2 indices computed with Random Forests and MARS weights.
\item \code{RF_vs_NN}: Same comparisons between Random Forests and neural networks.
\item \code{MARS_vs_NN}: Comparisons between MARS and neural network weighting.
\item \code{ci_rf}: Final DL2 index using Random Forest weights.
\item \code{ci_mars}: Final DL2 index using MARS weights.
\item \code{ci_nn}: Final DL2 index using neural network weights.
}
}
\description{
Computes and compares the final DL2 composite indicators obtained using
three alternative machine-learning methods for weight estimation:
Random Forests, MARS, and neural networks. The function evaluates the
degree of concordance between the resulting indices using Spearman,
Kendall, and Pearson correlations. This provides an empirical assessment
of the sensitivity of DL2 results to the choice of weighting methodology.
}
\details{
The function runs the \code{ci_ml_fixedpoint()} algorithm three times,
once using each machine-learning method to estimate the weights. It then
evaluates the agreement between the resulting composite indicators using
three classical rank or linear concordance measures:

\itemize{
\item \strong{Spearman}: monotonic ranking similarity,
\item \strong{Kendall}: pairwise ordinal consistency,
\item \strong{Pearson}: linear correlation.
}

These measures help assess the robustness of DL2 with respect to the choice
of weighting algorithm, guiding informed decisions when selecting the most
appropriate machine-learning method.
